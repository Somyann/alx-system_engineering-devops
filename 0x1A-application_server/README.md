API connectivity refers to using modular and reusable APIs to link data and applications in cloud-native environments. In contrast to API management, which focuses on managing the lifecycles of individual APIs, API connectivity encompasses loosely coupled, microservices environments where many APIs are communicating with each other and enables securing and governing APIs at scale in those architectures.
