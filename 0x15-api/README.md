What is a REST API? REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer â€” an almost meaningless description of the most-used web service technology! A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate using the HTTP technologies found in web browsers and servers.

Sharing data between two or more systems has always been a fundamental requirement of software development. For example, consider buying motor insurance. Your insurer must obtain information about you and your vehicle so they request data from car registration authorities, credit agencies, banks, and other systems. All this happens transparently in real time to determine whether the insurer can offer a competitive policy.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) help this type of communication between systems by providing an interface for them to talk to each other. REST is simply a widely adopted style of API that we use to communicate with internal and external parties in a consistent and predictable way. It can be compared with how we used to send a letter with a postage stamp, address, and envelope in a certain way to ensure it gets delivered and read.

REST is commonly used by people on the web systems to interact with each other. For example, retrieving and updating account information in a social media application.

Key Takeaways
REST APIs facilitate communication between computer systems using HTTP, enabling real-time data sharing among various services such as car registration authorities, credit agencies, and banks to offer services like motor insurance quotes.
A REST API operates on a set of recommendations for creating web services, including client-server architecture, statelessness, cacheability, and a layered system, making it a simple yet effective way to interact with web systems.
Implementing and consuming REST APIs involve considerations such as endpoint consensus, versioning, authentication, security, and handling multiple requests or unnecessary data, with tools like Swagger and Postman supporting development and testing.
